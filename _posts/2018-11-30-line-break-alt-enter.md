# Hitting `ALT+ENTER` for a new line

Pro Tip: hit `ALT+ENTER` to enter a line break in a cell.

Sometimes you want to use Excel to store text. Sometimes that text needs to be more than one line. The easiest way to type that into the cell is to use `ALT+ENTER` to add a line break. This will also automatically make the cell `Wrap Text` which is better for displaying line breaks. A couple other approaches to getting a line break in a cell:

- Use the `CHAR(10)` formula to add a line break
- Copy and paste a break from somewhere else (make sure you're editing a cell otehrwise your paste will add a new row)
