# Horizontal sorting

ProTip: you can sort a row of cells with the same commands as a column of cells. Use this for sorting column headers.

This one's obvious once you've seen it but typically sorting is viewed as going down a column. You can force Excel to sort cells horizontally as well. From the `Sort` menu, hit the options in the upper right, and then choose `Move Horizontally`. This will then give the choices down below using labels like `Row 1` and `Row 2` instead of the normal `Column A` and `Column B`. This can be used to simply sort cells horizontally or to reorder columns by sorting. It's more intuitive to think of sorting down a column, but just remember you can perform as the same operations transposed.

This technique is useful enough that I've create a simple macro which does it from a button click. The only downside to horitonal sorting is that Excel requires several clicks to do it.
